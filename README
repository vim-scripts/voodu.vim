This is an implementation of OOP with a decisively Perl flavor utilizing Vim 7.0's dictionary representation of objects.  More extensive documentation will be added at a later date.  I'm also aware of vimscript #1034 but it was pre-7.0 and thus doesn't utilize many of the features involved with Voodu.  For now, you can do the following:

let s:AD = tv#series#comedy#New('Arrested Development')
let s:TO = tv#series#comedy#New('The Office')

echo s:AD.name()
echo s:AD.type()
echo s:TO.name()." is a ".s:TO.type()

let s:SS = tv#series#comedy#New('The Simpsons')

" An example of Class Method accessing Class Data
echo tv#series#Names()

let s:dailyshow = tv#New('News Parody')
echo s:dailyshow.type()

--------------------------------------- Future Plans ---------------------------------------

I want to demonstrate the usefulness of this utility plugin by implementing generic tab/window/buffer classes that can hide a lot of the work I see plugin authors performing, e.g. wincommander, WinWalker, SideBar.

Additionally, I believe I can add functionality similar to Perl's Class::Accessor or Ruby's attr_reader:, namely automatic provision of simple accessor methods.
